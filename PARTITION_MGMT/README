Partition management tool originally developed by PalominoDB, inc. 
that I have adopted myself since few years.

For el9 (Rocky 9, etc) and later, on MariaDB, please use the el9 version of the script,
which leverages the DBD::MariaDB module instead of the old DBD::mysql one, which does not
work anymore.
