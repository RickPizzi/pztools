MariaDB Backup Manager - a backup-tool-agnostic backup and restore script for MariaDB
(c) 2018-2024 Rick Pizzi (pizzi@leopardus.com)

Highlights:

- supports full backups, incremental backups, binary logs backups, logical backups, 
  snapshots backups (ZFS only)
- configurable encryption and compression methods
- browsable backup inventory
- automatic and effortless restore to supplied point-in-time
- automatic rebuild of replicas from last backup, including replication
- automatic restore test
- automatic purging of old backups, with smart purge option
- email notifications
- filesystem capacity check (no more filesystem full due to backups)
- workload friendly when using mariabackup (if backup lock can't be obtained in 30 seconds, 
  give up instead of locking the workload waiting)

backup methods currently supported: xtrabackup, mariabackup, mysqldump, mydumper, zfs snapshots

 -- run backup_manager without options to access the online documentation --
