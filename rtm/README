RTM - a realtime transaction monitor for MariaDB

A small script that will behave much InnoTop, but instead of showing you tons of uninteresting information 
it will focus on transactions, with a view at a glance of the workload in real-time.

Can work interactively, or can be used in batch mode (--quiet) with --kill or --snap-if-waiting to monitor or
control a problematic workload.

As a bonus, a small C program that will help find transactions that took more than X seconds from a binlog file.

usage: ./rtm [ options ... ]

--host			hostname for connection to target instance

--kill			kill transactions running since X seconds or more (30-1800)
--locking-only		filter transactions holding row locks
--waiting-only		filter transactions waiting to acquire a lock
--snap-if-waiting-time	take a snapshot if there are transactions waiting X seconds or more
--snap-if-waiting-count	take a snapshot if at least X transactions are waiting
--snapshot-dir		directory to use for snapshots (default /tmp)
--use-file		display info from given file (useful with snapshots)
